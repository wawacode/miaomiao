Ionic Hacker News
=====================

This is a sample app built by the core team of Ionic. It's a means of "eating our own dogfood" by building a practical
app in Ionic. It was built using the [Ionic Tabs Starter](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-tabs).

This app makes no guarantees for stability. In fact, as it's a place we often test pre-release builds of Ionic, it's
often broken as we iron out new features for Ionic.

The app is a Hacker News reader. It allows you to browse, search, share, read, and view the comments of Hacker News
posts. It communicates with the [Firebase Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), and the [Algolia Hacker
News Search API](https://hn.algolia.com/api).

** Note**: The number of comments in the chat bubble is the number of top level comments
